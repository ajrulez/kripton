# Note about test
During development, you can need to view test's output. To enable test's output, you need to enable it with the creation of environment variable `KRIPTON_TEST_DEBUG`
and set it to `true`.

In eclipse enviroment, you can use a simple plugin to manage environment variables [Eclipse-Environment-Variables](https://github.com/JorisAerts/Eclipse-Environment-Variables).
